# Mongo Blogger Application

## Description:
The main goal of this project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on building the back-end side of an application with mongodb and mongoose. I also learned how to connect and reference collections between each other as well as populate through user input. And lastly I learned some better ways to access data through different methods with the mongoose interface.
